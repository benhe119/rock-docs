## Hardware Requirements

The analysis of live network data is a resource intensive task.  The bottom line is this: **if you throw hardware at ROCK it will use it, and use it well**. The higher the IOPS the better.  Here's a starting point to get you moving:    

|   RESOURCE  |     RECOMMENDATION |
| ----------- | ------------------ |
| CPU         | 4 or more physical cores |
| Memory      | 16GB ( 8GB to start, more the better ) |
| Storage     | 256GB, with 200+ of that dedicated to `/data`, SSD preferred |
| Network     | 2 gigabit interfaces, one for management and one for collection |
