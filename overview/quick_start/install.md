# Installation Guide

TL;DR - Installation is simple and straighforward.

1. apply image
1. generate defaults
1. confirm / edit config
1. deploy


## Apply the Image

Installing from the [ISO](https://github.com/rocknsm/rock/releases) is the preferred method to set up ROCK.  If that's for some reason not an option, alternate methods are listed [here](alt_install.md).

NOTE:  If you need details on how to apply the image to your USB or optical disk, see [media prep](media_prep.md).

- once booted to the live image, select the automated install and `ENTER`.

- click "User Creation" at the next screen complete the required fields to set up a non-root admin user.

- click "Finish Installation"

- accept licensing
