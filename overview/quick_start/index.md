# Quick Start Guide

## Hardware Requirements

**GOLDEN RULE:** If you throw hardware at it, ROCK will use it. It will require some tuning to do so, but we'll continue documenting that.  Throw everything you can at it. The higher the IOPS the better.

```
|   RESOURCE  |     RECOMMENDATION
| CPU         | 4 or more physical cores
| Memory      | 16GB (You can get away with 8GB, but it won't collect for long.)
| Storage     | 256GB, with 200+ of that dedicated to `/data`.
| Network     | 2 interfaces, one for management and one for collection.
```

NOTE: A more in-depth hardware guide can be found in the [wiki](../../wiki/devel/index.md).
