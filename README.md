ROCK is an open-source collections platform designed by the members of the Missouri National Guard Cyber Team (MOCYBER).  It's primary focus is to provide a **robust**, **scalable**, and **secure** sensor platform for both enduring security monitoring (NSM) and incident response (IR) missions.  Why choose us over the other names in the NSM game?  Continue on to the overview below.
